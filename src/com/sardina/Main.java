/**             OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
For this activity one process will be creating work orders and writing them to disk. Another process will read the work orders and then process them.

 The work order process is to first put the work order in the INITIAL pile. It next moves to the ASSIGNED pile (think of this as when the work order is assigned to someone). Next it moves to the IN_PROGRESS pile (when the person it was assigned to actually starts working on it.). And lastly it moves to the DONE pile (when the work is done).

//TODO:                 ### CONCLUSION OF INSTRUCTIONS ###
//TODO: Start creator by running Creator's main() method. Then start Processor by running its main.

//TODO: Now you have two console windows in IntelliJ. Create a work order in the creator window and watch the processor move it through the statuses.
