//TODO: In Processor have a public static void main that creates an instance of Processor and calls the instance method to that loops to process the work order files.

//TODO: The processWorkOrders method should ||(1).Run forever in a loop. Have the loop sleep for a five seconds (or longer). ||(2). Have a map with Status as the key and a Set of work orders for the value |=> print out the map |=>  move work orders from one map entry to the next (i.e., From IN_PROGRESS to DONE; from ASSIGNED TO IN_PROGRESS; from INITIAL to ASSIGNED). A work order should only transitioned once per loop. |=> print out the map || (3). Check for new work orders (files). For each new work order => reads the file into a WorkOrder object |=> removes the file |=> print out the work order |=> puts the work order in the INITIAL map entry.
